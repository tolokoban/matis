_Fast complex asynchronous processes made easy_


# Concepts

* __[Input driven execution](input-driven-exec.html)__: processing starts as soon as input is ready.
* __Parallelism__: tools are executed in parallel if it gives a time benefit. The result is a very fast process.
* __Inputs order preserved__: even if a tool processes 3 inputs at the same time, outputs are post to the next tool in the same order.
* __Tracability__: you always know which input has been needed to produce any output.
